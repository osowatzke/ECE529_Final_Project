		\item Description of Proposed Project:
		
			For the project, I plan to compare the performance of several different direction of arrival algorithms operating on data from a uniform linear array. These algorithms include beamforming, MVDR, MUSIC, improved MUSIC, Root Music, and ESPRIT. The performance of each alogorithm will be compared by examining their angle estimate outputs while varying simulation parameters. Parameters of interest include the number of elements in the uniform linear array, the spacing of elements in the uniform linear array, number of correlation samples, signal to noise ratio, number of sources, angle separation between sources, and correlation between source signals.

		\item Resources:
		
			MATLAB will be required to generate test data and execute each of the algorithms. MATLAB is available via an educational license from the University of Arizona.
			
		\item Software
		
			MATLAB
		
		\item Test Data	
			
			Test Data will be generated using MATLAB. Perfomance comparisons will be made by comparing angle errors for each of the techniques.
